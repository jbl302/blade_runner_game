This project is designed to help understand the nitty-gritty details of the Pygame module. It includes a basic runner-style game that can be executed using either `runner_class_only.py` or `runner_video.py`. Future improvements could involve implementing multiplayer functionality for offline settings and adding a leaderboard system.
